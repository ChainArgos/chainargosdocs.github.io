Welcome to the <img src="https://www.chainargos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/342x70-CA-Logo.png" width=113 height=23> documentation.

This is a combination of a blog and resource for users.
We use our own system to do research work - so investigative doubles as examples to help users.

Sometimes we also use this as a place to publish technical commentary that involves code snippets
and the like. That fits better here for back-end reasons including:
1. [github](github.com) is version controlled
2. markdown is great for describing code

Note: nearly all of these posts reference our system. If you are not a user some data may be
difficult to follow. Anyone interested in access should email <info@chainargos.com> or
DM us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChainArgos)
